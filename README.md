My goal is to use Machine Learning to forecast Stock Prize. In that purpose, I am comparing different methods, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Polyfit and Deep Learning using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The data set used here can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mattiuzc/stock-exchange-data). The following analysis is organized as follow. Firstly, I import and pre-process the data. Secondly, I am choosing two indexes NYA and N100 to perform the analysis. Thirdly, I compare different methods in Machine Learning. Finally, I build a RNN using a LSTM architecture to forecast the Stock prize for different parameters and visualize the results by plotting the time series.
